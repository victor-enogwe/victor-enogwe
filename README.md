### Here is a summary of me below

- I keep growing and learning, so the list must have improved before you read this.
- I am a creative with an eye for quality and a knack for developing and maintaining scalable web applications. 
- I love to follow best practices
- I love solving problems by programming
- I can also work in a super-fast paced startup environment, where fast product delivery, performance, maintainability, stakeholder management, and effective time utilization is key.
- I love people, food, a good book/movie/story and visiting new places - nothing makes me happier than volunteering and using my experience for a good cause.
